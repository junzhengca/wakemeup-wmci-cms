<span style="font-size:2em;">W</span>MCI requests the presence of <b>all Grade 12 students</b> to participate in our first <b>Youth Symposium</b> during the morning of <b>Friday, May 22, 2015</b>.  The focus of our symposium is contemporary issues that face society today.  We want to expose you to <b>community issues</b> and provide a platform for you to consider what type of actions you may be able to take as you enter the adult world.  This morning we will be sharing information with you through <b>stories, voices, and experiences</b>.<br><br>
Students need to select three sessions of interest using the sessions tab on this webpage.  Based on your choices, we will provide you with a schedule of sessions that includes time and location the morning of May 22.  Following our opening ceremony, you will experience a unique learning opportunity that we hope makes you <b>think, feel, and wonder</b>.<br><br>
